# L298N H-Bridge Motor Speed Controller
Use an Arduino (or any microcontroller) to control the speed (and direction) of a motor

Do you want to control that robot arm with a motor? Or a buggy? Or a model tank? Or a lathe? In fact, anything that uses a moderately low-power voltage source (up to 30v) can be easily controlled by the ubiquitous H-Bridge motor controller - but how does it work?

I'll show you the basics, then it will become very clear just why H-Bridge controller modules are so very desirable - cheap, easy to use and cost less than the price of a couple of MOSFETs!

In my example, I'll show motor speed control of a 2WD buggy that I'm building (just for fun) which makes it a doddle (UK-speak for very easy) to control the speed of the wheels. We'll see more of this buggy in a future video too, but this video is all about motor speed control.

But if you did want to buy from the Far East (so cheap!)
